## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Gulp
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt about accessibility issuses in navigation and slider. I learnt about a11y slider library and used it in my project. I practiced layout skills.

### Continued development

I would like to focus on accessibility issues, Javascript and Vue.js framework.

### Useful resources

- [Accessible hiding](https://a11y-guidelines.orange.com/en/web/components-examples/accessible-hiding/) - This helped me for understanding accessible hiding reasons.
- [Kevin Povell's videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4-IK0AVhVjNDRHoXGort7sDWcna8cGPA) - This is an amazing video series which helped me finally improve my solution. My approach was to prepare parts of my solutions and after watching Kevin's videos. I improve my solution with some his tips.
