### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to focus on accessibility issues and Javascript.

### Useful resources

- [Accessible hiding](https://a11y-guidelines.orange.com/en/web/components-examples/accessible-hiding/) - This helped me for understanding accessible hiding reasons. 
- [Kevin Povell's videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4-IK0AVhVjNDRHoXGort7sDWcna8cGPA) - This is an amazing video series which helped me finally improve my solution. My approach was to prepare parts of my solutions and after watching Kevin's videos. I improve my solution with some his tips.
